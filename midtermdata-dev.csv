I did not encounter any story focusing on sex.Although you may be right because after reading the ""The Rabbit's Bride""  I was thinking about more of pedophiles or people who abduct women for their own pleasure. I did not get simillar thought with other stories.For the fox meaning I found only this for now:""In pre-Christian Times the fox was seen as a symbol of gods, like for example, as a symbol of the god of vegetation or as a symbol of forest- and mountain-spirits. This changed in Christian Times, from where on the fox was seen as a demonic creature. The fox is a very famous figure in fables and usually is described as greedy, dishonest and tricky. At the same time of all the helpful animals in fairy tales the fox is said to be the most helpful one. Most fables tell about how the fox tricks other animals to get food, but no legends or fairy tales have been found telling about the fox attacking humans.""http://www.wsl.ch/land/products/predator/paper2.htm;I think that we should find something that we perceive as important in the stories.

The mother started the lie, the daughter can be seen as being loyal to the mother by not correcting the lie and therefore sullying the mother's word/reputation.   Then at the wedding the daughter/bride invites the three women in   as opposed to other girls in other tales who are cruel/break promises   to ugly characters and thereby incite their wrath. By keeping her word to the spinsters the daughter is rewarded by never having to spin again (or I guess actually   fake spinning again).     My point is I saw the girl as a dutiful daughter and keeper of promises (which is why she was rewarded), even if she was lazy and wouldn't learn to spin. :)And as an aside I can also see a more modern feminist reading of this as the solidarity of women-hood or some such--but sometimes I think we read more into these tales than we should :)Any way--just something that popped in my head. I meant this to light and fun in tone--not something that always comes across on the internet!;I totally agree that the mother and daughter were cunning. I think that's part of what I like about this story. And I understand the spinster/fates connection.  I also think I personally enjoy this story as a tale of the lower class/underdog 'getting one over' on the upper class.   If the situation were reversed and the Queen or Prince were taking advantage of a peasant and her daughter I would think that the tale was just awful.   But I guess that's human nature :)  I can also personally identify with wanting to get out of housework!   Though for me spinning is a fun hobby and not work. :)Obviously these are just fun personal observations and not meant as a great scholarly discourse. Watching the ""Rapunzel"" video now and I don't think I'll ever be able to do an actual ""close"" reading---totally missed the whole 'eye' imagery thing.

And what about   a lot (not all) of modern day fantasy writers who like to find pagan symbols behind the ""Christianized"" tales?   Are there really older versions of these tales that predate European Christianity that can be prescribed pagan meanings/symbols?   Does it even matter?

TRUE,St552,Coh2,1,0,0,11,40.0405,0.274722,4,0,4,0.003244646,0,"Rumpelstiltskin is attributed with female skills such as spinning, baking, brewing or dancing. He feels pity for the miller's daughter. He says about himself: ""I would rather have something living than all the treasures of the world"". At that point he is in total contrast to the king, who is simply interested in gold.  The first time, the king sees all the gold, he is astonished: So he never thought it being possible to the miller's daughter spinning gold out of straw. This may implicate two meanings: Either he does not care at all about a human life or he plays a quite cruel play to the miller's daughter in threatening her with death, maybe to force her to admit the truth: that she is not capable of spinning gold out of straw.Rumpelstiltskin gets the necklace and the ring. Maybe he takes a burden from the miller's daughter(?):The necklace may stand for being chained to someone or something, the ring as a visible sign of being engaged. He allows her extra time to think of his name. Does he act so because he underestimates the miller's daughter's ability? (like the king never thought of her spinning ability?) Why does he not fear the possibility, that she may tell the king? He puts himself into danger at that point. Does he know that the miller's daughter and meanwhile Queen will not tell her husband the truth? That she will more likely risk to lose her child?The Miller's daughter does not try to defend herself in front of the king. Why does she not speak for herself and tell the truth? Why does she think: ""But who knows whether that will happen?""   Does she not take for serious her situation?   Rumpelstiltskin at last cries: ""The devil told you that!"" How may we understand this? The devil is the only one, who knows Rumpelstiltskin's name? Or that, like Faust, she does not hesitate to beg the devil's support? (Do you know the Lilith-Myth in the Talmud? Lilith was Adam's first wife. She was equal to him and not willing to get into submission. She knew God's secret name. When God in Adam's demand tries to force her to be submissive to Adam   and him, she cries out loud his name and therefore gets banned from paradise into desert.) So in the Christian-Jewish tradition there is a secret around God's name. In the end the Miller's daughter becomes a very powerful Queen. She ascends socially and her child stays with her!   Hope you find my thoughts on Rumpelstiltskin interesting!;It's really fine, that you liked my comment.I watched somewhat closely to the brewing and baking thing. In a German encyclopedia   ""Bier-Lexikon"" I found an article about the brewing origin (title: Einst war das Brauen Frauensache - which means: There was a time when Brewing was a femals business). Very famous was the Holy Hildegard of Bingen for her universal knowledge and one of her skills was the knowledge about beer brewery. But you may go back in history even to the old Germanic People: in these times the women brewed the beer.Going back to the Brothers Grimm: they were part of the Romanticism movement in Germany at that time. They wanted to create a new intellectual world, referring to their german origins. The Romanticists were idealistic, highly sensitive intellectuals, poetrists, philosophers, scientists, artists and musiciens of all kinds. They came together in so called ""Literarische Salons / Jour fixe"", which, by the way quite often were arranged by sophisticated young women like Rahel Levin Varnhagen, Henriette Herzberg or Dorothea Schlegel   discussing their philosophical, aesthetical or social ideas.In these movement quite a lot of famous women became writers (Caroline von G _nderode, Madame de Stael [who was a french artist], Bettina von Arnim). Here   a new intellectual world opened its windows to women and men. This was quite new!;I read your post and felt really touched . I had a time, when I was not able to read any kind of literature without detecting racists, mysogyne or else discriminating implications. I gave up reading for a while.  Than I started to search for those hidden traces of female or else subversive, fragmented culture or discourse. What I think is really important is to find reflections on your own feelings, abilities, desires, confessions or maybe prejudices?! This is, what reading and reflection on myths and motives in literature really means to me.During the last summer I read some of John Irvings novels. I don't know, whether or not Irving is a persona non grata in the American literature scene, but I really liked his openmindedness to personal concepts. I found, which is really quite rare among male writers, that he loves his female protagonists, he loves all kind of bodies, especially the imperfect ones. The most intact, sane persons in his novels are those, who are female and male attributed characters, the closer to 100 %female or male they come, the more rude or stupid or simply disgusting are theyThink of that and be at ease with yourself. You are who you are. We are all in different ways disabled, imperfect, not mainstream, not fitting in those aesthetic, social or gender common places. Maybe a great deal of writers felt that way to -which lead to their writing and our reflections on it!;Dear Megan,Owen Meany is own of my all-time-favorite novels. I totally agree with you. I enjoyed reading this book and I really loved Owen!As to Barbara Kingsolver I don't know her yet, but I'm always   thankful to discover ""new"" as we call it ""Lesefutter"" (reading food, so to say). Thank you for your insights.Andrea;Megan,Thank you for your short ""book review"": I will keep it in mind, since it sounds/reads really interesting!;It's not necessesarily obedience and/or beauty which leads to the ""happy end""! Look at the princess in  ""Frog Prince"": she breaks the curse in being disobedient and rejecting the inappropriate, even disgusting demands of the frog (and her father!).   The step-mother in ""Snow-White"" is beautiful, but she needs to be the most beautiful of all. Her envy and recklessness, her life-threatening attitude towards Snow-White leads to her terrible death. Snow-White is the most beautiful of all, but she is arrested in a quasi death status from the very beginning. She, not unlike her step-mother, lets herself over to seduction of pretty things. Finally she becomes a ""beautiful jewel in a tresor of glas"", really beautiful to look at and placed on the top of a mountain, so that everybody may see her! Spitting out the treacherous, seductive apple is the healing (with which she has been fed by her step-mother).;I really appreciate the article you posted here, because it refers to a variety of gender aspects discussed in this forum. One of my favourite questions is this: ""Why did we lose all those male counterparts to Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and the girl who becomes the wife of the Frog King?""My simple answer would be: Because the boys, when they came of age, entered the real, challenging world: They went abroad, journeyed to foreign countries in the trading business, as students or (most exciting) as explorers like Georg Forster or Alexander von Humboldt, they became independent. Whereas the young, well educated, intelligent women stayed at home, in the golden ""bird-cage"" of their fathers or husbands. Where could they travel else than in their fantasy? Why should they tell stories about dragons and ogres and female knights? They wanted to be powerful queens. They wanted to be admired and loved: because if they were not in reality, can you imagine such a life of tristess?The Grimms collected ""their"" fairy tales in a quite comfortable, completely unmagical way: they found female narrators in befriended families: these pretty, sophisticated, intelligent women. Than, because the female versions were at times quite slippery and too obviously connotated with female (especially sexual) needs, they overworked them, made them attractive to a possibly male, quite more often to an audience of children. (You may find interesting following links on 2 German magazine articles: http://www.zeit.de/zeit-geschichte/2012/04/Maerchen-Brueder-Grimm-Urspr _nge: ""M _rchen  _ber M _rchen"" and http:www.zeit.de/2012/50/Brueder-Grimm-Maerchen-Roelleke: ""Weder deutsch noch Volk""; Heinz R  lleke is a Professor emeritus of German Philology and an Expert on the Brothers Grimm).Hope you like my comment;Exactly! A lot of them   (and maybe those who became the most famous ones) were of French origin. First the Grimms did not know themselves. When they knew about it, they kept silent, because they wanted to work on a real German folkloristic collection. Of course in a sense they made them their own: because they overworked them.I was astonished myself when reading these Articles!;As I am mother of two girls (12 and 10 years old) I have a perspective from both sides:   as the story-teller of bedtime stories to my girls and as a former child listener to these stories.Yesterday we (girls and I) talked about the Grimm fairy tales and it turns out that they both have different favorite ones. The older one loved the seven raven; she was really scared about Hansel and Gretel, especially about the witch. The younger one loved Rapunzel and Sleeping beauty (Dornr  schen) and The Goose-Girl.   Both found their way to understand the tales and ignore those parts, they were scared of or which they didn't really understand. When they were very small I ""censored"" the stories, where they were extremely punishing to the vicious step-mothers. My younger daughter yesterday evening begged me to read Sleeping beauty and Snow-White to her. She had a good night's sleep afterwards!I myself, when I was a child,   loved the Grimm tales: My favorite tales were Hansel and Gretel and The Beauty and the Beast (which was no Grimm tale but a French one). Of course I enjoyed a lot of other fairy tales too, but these were my favorites.The ""In"" and ""Out"" as you put it is most certainly sexually connoted. During my reading of the Household stories for this course I stumbled over some interesting sources in a German magazine, Die Zeit online. It is said there, that the Grimm brothers collected a great deal of their tales from young, well educated women. The fairy tales often were so obviously sexually inclined, that they overworked them to make them more ""children-compatible"". You may read my other posts on this theme under the post ""Dealing with Bigotry"" and ""Representation of women in Grimm's Fairy Tales"".;Did you use other interpretations, texts, literature sources to underline your thesis and your thoughts?

I'd read Perrault's fairy tales recently (before signing up for this course) and it's interesting to see how they differ.   In Perrault's version of The Sleeping Beauty, they don't live happily ever after after she's woken up but the Sleeping Beauty has to contend with a jealous mother-in-law once she's married - I like the tales that break this ""happily ever after"" idea.   I know it's repetitive but I like how there are so many similar stories (like Mother Hulda and The Three Little Men In The Wood), that have obviously been collected from different places but have probably  evolved from an original story, just like nowadays you have the Disney version of fairy tales competing with other versions.   So you think of these Grimms' tales as the original but really they're probably only versions of original stories that were passed down verbally.;"

Now that I think of that, the transfer of oral tradition into the written form might have been really meaningful - if before (grand)parents decided which stories the child was ready to hear based on their maturity and personal qualities, how to narrate and explain them, which details to highlight or omit, what is printed in a book is much closer to being set in stone for anyone to read and draw their independent conclusion.

Perhaps especially for these fairy tales, perhaps it is that the reading is done within a few days, but I feel almost like taking notes might be intrusive on my subconscious enjoyment and stirring of ideas.     Of course there are some times I am driven to write something down, but that is usually a result of the stirring, rather than notes for notes sake.I am a little bit procrastinating because of this....I think...conflicted, maybe. I don't want to proceed with the idea that I am ""supposed to take notes"" as opposed to doing it naturally, for my own reasons.  Anyone else?   Or anyone have any thoughts? probably silly altogether. normally I make a lot of notes...signed, conflicted idealist in need of coffee;The Grimm Collection of tales only says that it is that. As Disney takes public domain stories and tells them, the Disney collection is unique, so does the Grimm Brothers, as well as the translators of each edition. None of these  are the verbal versions, and none are the verbal versions that would have been those of any particular person, family, town, or area.It's a collection, the meaning of which is in the grouping itself as well as the content. Imagine in some families one might have heard only the tales such as the Six Soldiers or The Gallant Tailor, where one might aspire to greatness from lowly beginnings, and perhaps not be quite perfectly fair in doing so. In other families one might hear only tales of warning not to be greedy, or other things of value to their own personal history.I am curious to hear Prof Rabkin on the reason for the collection. I am resisting the temptation to look it up, in the spirit of the course syllabus and order of things:)   I imagine that it is quite different from, say Disney Corp's reason for their collection (""buy things! aspire to buy things! Be good, and serve well, and you will be able to buy things!"" (and let's not forget ""brave is good, but also be sexy, girls!"");I've come to think that these tales are more like observations on life and people, like a sociology lesson, or how the world works. Perhaps the character development needed in the locale of each tale, or version, varied, depending on whether ones local king or queen (or local leaders) were kind and generous, or horrid and cruel and to be avoided.   Thus in some stories we see that getting away with what you can is fair enough and one gets away with it, as in   'Six Soldiers of Fortune', as opposed to faithfulness, service and loyalty   to the point of self sacrifice, win the day as in 'Faithful John' , where we might imagine that the local King would have been worthy of supporting to such great lengths, and thus we pass these qualities on as desirable in this location and time.I found myself wondering about what the local civilization was like from story to story, how they might live, what they value, what is acceptable, what is worthy, or not,   given the tale told.;True, although it was that his actions that were morally questionable and still won the day for our Jack-of-all-trades.   So we can assume that what is valued there in the locale and time of this tale,   would be to fight for what is right and deserved at all costs, the ends justifies the means. Not all societies agree that the end justifies the means. There is some greed in our 'hero' in Six Soldiers, for example, as he takes all of the kingdom's gold, that here is acceptable, where in an other story, that might be his downfall.;The story begins with Hans telling his master that he is finished with his seven years, and wants only to go see his mother. He asks for his wages   only so that he can be on his way to her.The value of the gold to the employer shows what he thought of Hans' work, as did his words ""You have served me truly and faithfully,"" and ""as the service is, so must the wages be"". So we see Hans as a worthy character to be admired. If we take that into consideration, then perhaps we can view   that Hans is truly 'in luck' whether he perceives it and we do not, or he perceives it and it is true (or not).   I think it may well be about how 'luck' is things that come along at the right place and right time, and also a matter of perception and character, ones outlook on life.   After all, in Hans' eyes, he enjoyed everything he traded for, and when he began to not enjoy it, he easily found something to exchange it for, bringing him new happiness again.These threads about the stories are fun and thought provoking, I can't wait to read the essays:);I do think that the story's intention is as you say. Otherwise we might have heard at the end of the mothers lament at the loss of the gold. As that is not mentioned, it probably should not be implied, except perhaps in one's own version of the story, when told anew:);I wonder if this point will make a difference to how anyone views Hans- he is not in fact ""quitting his job"", but rather reached the end of his traditionally 7 year long apprenticeship, where one learns a trade and aids their mentor in exchange for food and lodging. Traditionally they would be given something for their service, almost a token of luck, to help them begin their new life working at what they've just apprenticed at.So, Hans did not simply quit and wander on home, it was the end of his term of servitude for the apprenticeship.;It seemed to me that it was a tale of how a lot of   greedy characters and their own self interest will cause a venture to fail.   They were all willing to help in exchange for something before they would help, and in the end they all failed and it was their undoing. You can have as many half-hearts half helping as you wish, but you will all fall to a bad fate if the most important thing is their selfishness.;I agree with Gustavo, using personal feelings to illustrate points can be effective.

When Professor Rabkin talks about it he says that we're not talking about Freudian version of the Oedipus complex, but rather, we're referring to the actual myth of King Oedipus. I failed to see how the ""generational struggle"" was a major component of the original myth. King Oedipus was never fighting for his wife's affections; he was awarded them because he defeated the Sphinx. It would be nice if someone could provide a simple definition of oedipal structure because I'm still a bit confused. Thank you.  ;I had the same experience. Evaluators took of points because they claimed that we were only supposed to read the Hawthorne stories specifically named on the syllabus. I believe they are mistaken.

I thought the syllabus said we are responsible for all the stories in Mosses of an Old Manse, Twice-Told Tales, and The Portable Poe. I know that's a lot to read, but so far the bar has been set pretty high for this course's workload.  ;Anyway, this is what I originally thought, but I stand corrected. There is a separate section that denotes the specific readings:  In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne's ""The Birthmark,"" ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,"" and ""The Artist of the Beautiful""; Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Oval Portrait,"" ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,"" ""The Bells,"" ""The Raven,"" ""Annabel Lee.""  All the readings except Ray Bradbury's  The Martian Chronicles  and Ursula K. LeGuin's  The Left Hand of Darkness  will be available online at no charge.I guess I just overlooked this information. Ooops.  ;Emmanuelle, that couldn't have been my essay you read. I discussed ""The Bosom Serpents,"" not the ""Tell-Tale Heart."" I'm really disappointed with myself that I didn't analyze the assigned stories for this essay. I could have just as easily used ""The Birthmark"" and ""Rappaccini's Daughter"" to support my thesis.  Oh well.  I've  decided to post my essay  in case you're interested in reading it. Enjoy.  In  Doctor Who, a British science fiction drama,  the lead character suggests that both    the devil    and the    things that men do    are the same thing in the end. Although Hawthorne did not believe these ideas were entirely the same, his writings show a greater concern for the    things that men do    because of evil's ubiquitous nature.  Even though Hawthorne personally believed in the existence of a devil, his journal entries never explored the nature of Satan.   When his stories gave evil a physical form, the forms were metaphorical. For example, in    Young Goodman Brown    Satan bears a    considerable resemblance    to the protagonist and has the same    rank and file.    By drawing this comparison, Hawthorne wants the reader to think about the evils inside of Brown   s own heart. By the end of the story Goodman Brown himself becomes the most frightful thing in the forest. Hawthorne turns the reader's attention to the evil that every human is capable of.  We see this again in    Egotism,    when the sin of pride appears as one   s own personal snake. Even though the Bible has portrayed Satan as a snake, the serpent here does not represent Satan but rather reflects Hawthorne   s own personal belief of original sin.   This idea is supported through Roderick   s suggestion that there   s    poisonous stuff in any man   s heart to generate a brood of serpents.   Rosina confirms the metaphorical nature of the serpent when she says that    what it typified is as shadowy as itself.     The greatest danger to Hawthorne was looking at other   s sins without acknowledging the evil lurking within. It   s just like the narrator of    Young Goodman Brown    says:    The fiend is less hideous than when he rages in the breast of man.    For Hawthorne, the fiend wasn   t some noisy beast devouring souls; she was the sultry voice already inside our heads     distorting our self-concepts.  Hawthorne, Nathaniel.

I've been doing some research to try to find out what Hawaiian or Pacific Island tradition this refers to. We know that it must be a Pacific Island tradition because Dr. Moreau mentions in chapter 14 that the  Kalaka people are the ones who educated the gorilla. I find it a very strange coincidence that the Shaka sign that surfers use today  demonstrates 3 missing fingers just as the gorilla's gesture does. Is there a correlation here? As far as I can tell, the history of the Shaka sign only dates back to the 1950s, nearly a century after Wells wrote The Island of Dr. Moreau. It's possible that some portion the Shaka sign's history has been forgotten. Maybe there was a protosymbol that predated the Shaka sign that time has forgotten. If anyone could shed some light on this issue, I might actually be able to sleep tonight. I'm dying to figure this out. Here is  what is already known about the history of the  Shaka sign: think:  http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/7837-the-history-of-the-famous-surfing-shaka-sign;Here is the passage I was referring to:  [The Gorilla] seemed puzzled at something. His eyes came back to my hands. He held his own hand out and counted his digits slowly,    One, two, three, four, five     eigh?    I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I was to find that a great proportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes even three digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, I did the same thing by way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction. Then his  swift roving glance went round again; he made a swift movement     and vanished.Perhaps I was mistaken to call this a ""greeting"" because now that I read it again, I see that Edward, once he discovered that it was common for these Beast People to be missing up to 3 fingers, no longer thinks it's a greeting. Nevertheless, I am still convinced this gesture has a meaning. The gorilla responds to the sign with ""immense satisfaction."" This tells me that the symbol has some sort of personal meaning to the gorilla, perhaps even to the Kalaka people who trained him as well.;Hello everyone!

I like to interpret this as a science fiction novel which expresses the fear of technology's impact on our society and our survival.Saying the monster didn't exist is like saying that the machines weren't really harvesting the humans for energy in the Matrix (first movie) and that Keanu Reeves was just hallucinating. Both interpretations work, but the latter robs the story of its meaning.;I'm sorry to say that I thought both were pretty monotone. I thank god that Shelley at least had a better vocabulary. Whenever Stoker had to describe something positive he used the words 'good', 'sweet', 'pretty' and 'pure' no matter who the narrator. He even once described Mina as 'good, good, sweet, sweet' as if by repeating the same words he somehow made it better. As for the vampires, the only word he used to describe them was 'voluptuous'.Shelley has a better grasp over basic descriptions but nuanced characters and the power of suggestion seem to be beyond both their powers.;Your idea is very interesting. I don't really agree with it, mainly because I didn't see Shelley at any time even hint that this possibility is something she considered worth exploring. However, I see what you are driving at. The great similarity in the stories of the creator and creation can be an indication of a split personality. I mean:- Victor has intellectual passion that results in a discovery that results in monster.- Monster has academic inclinations that result in its question of identity that result in its anger.- Monster's anger results in victor's anger (death of William) and fear.- Victor's anger brings destruction upon Monster's bride.- Monster's anger brings destruction upon Victor.They have a symbiotic relationship going on. It literally looks like they feed off of each others passions. This could Victor's convoluted way of not taking responsibility for the deaths. He could attribute his creation of the monster to intellectual curiosity and the destruction of the bride to saving the planet from a new species. This would justify all the murders in the novel. I mean sure, he would feel bad and blame himself, but in his heart of hearts, he would know that he couldn't have done anything to stop that monster. It could be for this comfort that he creates this monster, as a thing to take the fall for his own misconducts. I don't entirely believe this, but its possible.What I find much more interesting is the suggestion that knowledge leads to misery. By the monster's own admission, its knowledge of human affairs was what led it to question its own identity, existence, and loneliness, thus ultimately leading to its grief. Frankenstein's acquisition of an amazing scientific advancement was what sealed his fate. Now, i am not a Christian, so I don't know if this is true, but in Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card, there is a biblical allusion to the tree of knowledge vs the tree of life. The implication (in the novel) is that superior powers of intellect must be compensated for by a shorter life. However, Mary Shelley goes way beyond this. She equates life to eros (life-force or sexual instinct) exhibited in Victor's act of creation and the monster's desire for a wife. Due to the consumption of the fruit from the tree of knowledge, the eros is converted to thanatos which is:  ""the hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state"". This is exhibited by Victor tearing up the monster's bride as well as the monster's murders. More disturbingly, Victor's pursuit of knowledge, the creation of the monster, threatened the logos, or the rationality principle. The monster's framing of Justine and its misuse of its knowledge of our justice system (note the similarity of the name Justine to justice) causes Elizabeth to begin to doubt in the integrity and fairness of the justice system. The monster begins to sow the seeds of anarchy, upsetting the smooth rationality of the current institutions.Thanatos is associated with counter-intuitive or unnatural behavior (such as the historical events the monster studied about). Murder definitely qualifies as both. Mary Shelley has repeatedly shown how the thirst for knowledge results in the unnatural and the grotesque. Although Frankenstein is a science fiction novel, rather than heralding the future, it shies away from it. In the novel, science is seen as something which disturbs the balance and progress as endangering the status quo. Any form of change (both social and evolutionary) is seen with fear. I find this regressive knowledge vs life attitude to be the central conflict of this novel, and in today's context, I think that this view is completely outdated. Right now, innovation is the only way to solve the world's problems. Retreating to the Swiss Alps and acting as if the industrial revolution never occurred isn't going to help. Neither are novels like Frankenstein.;I felt the same about the destruction of the bride. What I found even more annoying were the huge descriptions of natural beauty that seemed to have no bearing on the novel. I love huge descriptions when they are actually there for a purpose, such as symbolism or atmosphere (like in H P Lovecraft) but when they are repetitive scenes of beauty which serve no purpose other than to reiterate the protagonists despondency for the millionth time, I get kinda pissed off!;I think that large vision is never an excuse for shoddy craftsmanship. A writer cannot be a great artist with a brilliant story and no technique. The novel which suffers from this defect cannot be a great novel.;I think Frankenstein recoils from the monster because he is his own creation. Creation in the 19th century was attributed to God and the idea of man having the power to grant life must have been considered horrific. It is this belief which branded Frankenstein, his otherness caused by the identity of his creator. Before he was animated, Frankenstein's bench-mark of beauty must have been sculpture or works of art. However, after giving him life, Victor has challenged God and therefore, since man is inferior to God, his creation must also be inferior to God's creation. On animation, the bench-mark shifts to the perfection of the human form, and the monster falls short due to the human identity of his creator.;"

Your overall grade is the average of your highest seven essay grades.The essay marks are based on the peer evaluations. Each essay should be evaluated by approximately 5 peers, and the mark you get allocated for the essay is based on the mark they each give you out of six. I can't remember if it's the median mark of the five grades, or the average after removing the highest and lowest.Peer marking isn't always the best solution but in this case there are  far too many of us for the uni staff to mark them all personally. I think the principle of having multiple markers and only needing to complete 7 essays to pass is that any extreme marking gets cancelled out and if you're really unlucky with your peer-markers one week then at least that shouldn't affect your overall course mark too much.

In a time when survival was often the only reward for being a morally upright person, this sort of tale would make far more sense to the average person than one of rags to riches; keep in mind that these were the tales of the common man, not the literati. Hence the name Hausm _rchen. With ""The Death of the Hen,"" the importance of honor and duty to community are emphasized. In addition, the interconnected of a community's members is also stressed. It is because the Hen, in her gluttony (a sin) breaks her oath, which in turn sets of a cascade of tragic events that ultimately destroys the community. We see this in the very delineated way in which the events progress, e.g., the Cock goes to the Brook to get some water for the choking hen, then goes to the Bride to get some silk, then to the willow to get the garland. All of these events and the ones that lead up to everyone's death are set in motion by the seemingly inconsequential action of the Hen breaking her oath. But in the times in which these stories developed, lack of commitment and faithfulness to one's community often meant death for that community, even the original transgression was not done out of malice. This is summed up by the last line: ""And they were all dead together"" (emphasis added).This sense of honor and duty are fundamental German virtues. So while the story does indeed have a tragic ending, that tragic ending is brought about by the failure to live up to the morality of the community. In this way the moral lesson is taught through what is lost, rather than what is gained.   ;Hello! I'm from Chicago too. Well, the Western suburbs, to be more precise.  ;"

Perhaps you would have focus on just one example, and link it more to your thesis?;Hi all,  Below is my essay. Is my essay really as bad as what my peer 1 says? Feel free to criticize it...By choosing to divide the chapters of  Dracula  into various chapters based on the journals or diary entries of the various characters in the novel, Bram Stoker has successfully made the readers immersed themselves into the innermost thoughts and emotions of those characters.Why is this so?By their nature, journals and diary entries are private and are often meant to be read by either the writer themselves, or their closed ones. Therefore, the authors of such entries are often free to write about their innermost thoughts and feelings, as they knew that they would be relatively safe from the prying eyes of nosy strangers.Take for example, in the first chapter, Jonathan Harker wrote in his journal entries about the various meals he had during his journal to Transylvania. Almost as an aside, Jonathan noted that he had asked for the recipe of those dishes for Mina. Such details would normally not be omitted from novels written in the conventional manner, as they are superfluous and not necessary for the progression of the plot. However, Bram, by adding such intimate details into the novel, it makes the readers feel like they are actually peeking into the mind of Jonathan. This has the effect of closing the distance between the reader and Jonathan, and making the readers feel that they understood more about what goes on in Jonathan   s psyche.Furthermore, by their nature, diary entries and journals lack the omniscient narrator, and are based upon the memory of the author themselves. Therefore, their accuracy is not expected to be perfect, just like how human nature is. Precisely due to their imperfect nature and reminiscence to reality, Bram, has succeeded in making the readers feel that the story had really occurred in real life. This would, in turn, make them feel more for the trials and ordeals of the protagonists.Form:peer 1      First of all, it is very obvious that you are not a natural English speaker. Your words are definitely not used properly, there are many mistakes in this regard, for example ""during his journal to Transylvania"" /I believe you meant ""journey""/. English grammar is also very neglected, there is also inproper use of tenses.

Surely it would be better to number them in order (1-5) as you go along.;Overall Grade: 4.5The Grimm Brothers: Growth and Fertility Many themes are presented throughout the Grimm Brothers tales. Coming  of age is one, where transitions of womanhood and the beginnings of  fertility are represented. With this comes loss of innocence and leaving  behind childhood. In the tale of Rapunzel, the fertility theme is presented  early, with Rapunzel   s mother longing to eat salads of rampion. When the  King   s son climbs through the window, Rapunzel is shocked as she comes  face-to-face with the first man she has ever laid eyes upon. Her coming  of age occurs when she accepts his hand in marriage, thus becoming his  wife and the bearer of his children. With Aschenputtel,  fertility is represented by the lentils that she must pick up. She is no  longer a child when the King   s son recognises her as his partner and  takes her for his wife. Sleeping Beauty dives deeper into the state of fertility,  with Rosamund pricking her finger. The blood from this is a symbol of  the medieval belief that a child becomes a woman when she begins  menstruation. In addition, Rosamund falls asleep as a child and wakes up  as a woman. The thorns surrounding the castle are an icon of growth and  serve as a cocoon until the 100 year curse is complete. Similar to this  is the tale of Snow White, where she falls asleep as a na  ve  child and wakes as a learned woman. In this example, the reader is made  aware early on of Snow White   s coming of age, as she becomes fairest of  all. The ripened apple acts as the symbol of fertility. The coming of age and happiness of these women depends upon their  attachments to a male and their social acculturation. This theme is  constant throughout these tales up until the end, where they cannot  remain or return home to their states as children.Works Cited: Rapunzel; Aschenputtel; Sleeping Beauty; Snow White - Grimm - Children's and Household Tales (Lucy Crane translation).FORM = 2peer 2      This student's grammar and punctuation are very good.

I think you are forgetting that immortality to Tom Riddle was a means to an end - namely an undead dictator who led by fear, not love. His image was meant to be terrible and not necessarily convey his desire for immortality, because in a way, he already had it. This is actually more similar to Dracula. Both had immortality and had to be whittled down first before destruction.Remember, that immortality is something Tom Riddle already had by the time he took the name Voldemort.  ;Excellent point. If I could revise my earlier assessment, I would say that Voldemort both feared death and wished to wield it as weapon. His earlier focus on horcruxes was replaced before the final battle with his search for the death wand. What was his motivation for this search? Because in so wielding, he would be immortal? Perhaps he believed that, but as we know from the story, all three brothers died because of their gifts. I am now wondering if his violent actions were intended to create a kind of horrific immortality upon the minds of muggles and magic-born alike.I feel like I need to re-read Riddle's earlier life in The Half-Blood Prince again. I just remember so much of the last book, but perhaps there are deeper motivations I neglected. I still think of Tom as that crying baby who inflicted his pain on others, very similar to Hitler, Napoleon and other similar ambitious world dictators.;A final point is that there is no immortality of physical form, even for the gods. Destruction can always occur as in the case of Dracula and Voldemort. Immortality is a dream with so many caveats so as to not be in itself immortality. Being perpetuated in history or converted to another form is a type of immortality, but not in keeping with the dream as I understand it.Is immortality the same as invincibility? After all, even those who are invincible may be subject to forces outside of human control, such as time or gravity.;Although I though Dracula overlong, the sexual puns, suggestions that both Arthur and Jonathan were cockolds, and the ridiculous justifications of what it means to be male or female has me in stitches.Throughout the entire time, I was wondering if this was merely a modernist view of Dracula and NOT what a contemporary Victorian audience would have seen.Two incidents of particular were of note to me. When Nina is walking back with Lucy, she makes a point to cover her feet in mud, so that from a distance it will look to a passerby that she is wearing shoes. Isn't that a bit extreme and laughable? And then of course, the first visit of Lucy's tomb, the ""sperm"" from Van Helsing's candle drips onto her face plate. As I understand it, there may have been something about whale sperm used in the wax of candles then, but still, isn't this an outward display of a lecherous old man?For me, the puns and allegory was so suggestive, that like reading Romeo and Juliet, I could help but laugh rather than being frightened by Dracula.;"

Especially since we have so many Victor Frankenstein's around. Honestly, there is nothing that suggests to me that he should have compounded his creation by creating a female version. How was that supposed to work... I mean, really?! The movies that convey a Mrs. Frankenstein Monster are accurate, I think. She would kill herself...that the male counterpart doesn't suggests more selfishness than Victor ever did.Victor is self-absorbed, but his situation has become that of the modern man. Most of us sacrifice technology for a personal connection to someone. The fact we are taking an online class is proof enough of that. I've also thought of Frankenstein as less a morality play (because the moral is way too transparent) and more of an allegory. The parallels between Victor and his monster are startling and I'm surprised in bringing up Forbidden Planet, Professor Rabkin failed to mention how the monster represents Victor's id or super-ego, depending on his state.;I understand where you're coming from, but his creature's wish is anything but modest. I appreciate that few have any sympathy for Frankenstein, but for the same reason, you should have little sympathy for the murderous monster he created.Two points. Victor did everything he could for Justine. If he told the truth, it would be a wild story. And just like in the real world, it is almost impossible to overcome a murder's confession, no matter what her intention. I really cannot comprehend this critique of Victor. Criticize him for isolating himself at Ingolstadt in his studies, leaving the monster immediately after its creation or any other number of issues, but Justine's death is an unavoidable consequence of his monster.As for ""modest wish"", Victor already lost two people to the monster's rage and you believe those deaths should be rewarded? If we are to make the monster a child (which his speech and thought processes are certainly nothing like a child's), then he should be punished and being too powerful to punish, perhaps destroyed. Would Victor be more sympathetic if he destroyed his monster with some clever trick? I think Mary Shelley intentionally had Victor as spineless, so that the tragedy could play its way through like a classic Greek tragedy. But I cannot see how giving him a woman would have satiated him. As a woman, Mary Shelley knew that there is no such thing as ""giving someone a woman', because you cannot guarantee love or satisfaction. And would sex even be possible with no hope of procreation? Would that please the monster or would he come killing more people for getting the power to procreate over time? How much is enough for such a powerful, unstoppable creature?;Isn't that the interesting bit? Neither Victor nor his monster are a complete person. Victor is able to give life, but cannot take it, while the monster deals death with no ability to procreate. It is a tragic divorce that suggests separating Victor from his creation is not an answer to the questions brought up in the story.;I think this a valid critique of Victor - he is mentally imbalanced, almost unhinged in his sanity. Constantly he doubts reality and what is happening to him. This makes for passages filled with self-doubt, suggesting he is a poor choice of narrator. He does try to reason with authorities, but he knows, just like we do, that there is no way to save Justine. No one would believe him that a monster he created was clever enough to plant a locket in revenge of its creator! This plea rarely works with humans much less anything else. What you are reading in the narrative is how Victor uses Justine's trial as a sense of horror rather than a detailed blow-by-blow courtroom drama. Do you really think Mary Shelley intended us to condemn Victor for Justine or that she just wanted the natural chain of tragedy to impact him?;I appreciate that viewpoint and no doubt Professor Rabkin does, too. I do not think it is wrong, just not my opinion. I do not like Victor, but to criticize him so heavily as to claim that is the moral point of the novel I cannot agree with. The problem with Victor is that he creates a monster, but has no capacity or ability to parent it. I think the point is not that others couldn't have tried more ways to love it, but that as humans with the right to create, we are inherently selfish creatures, able to create life but genetically questionable in protecting it. It is easy to criticize Victor until you realize that some of his behaviors actually hit home. It is his creation that rips his life asunder, not him. I agree that Victor's poor relationships may have provided touchpoints for the monster, but it is the monster and Victor's inability to understand and control it.I have often seen the monster as the symbol of industrialization and innovation. How often have we created something only to find that we have no control of how it is used, misused and possibly tears our contemporary existence apart? Ultimately, you may hate Victor, but his pain is ours as well, no matter our best intentions.;Ultimately, we are to feel sympathy for both Victor and his monster, but never to lose sight of the shortcomings of both. They both are examples of how NOT to be and BOTH of them are warnings for us all.;An interesting article I'd thought to share...  http://kaylathetheoxenophile.wordpress.com/professional-readings/a-literary-criticism-on-nathaniel-hawthornes-dr-heideggers-experiment-using-a-formalistic-approach-centered-on-deciphering-studied-texts-symbols-to-find-its-speci/ I agree with its conclusion ... do you?   Yes, Dr. Heidegger   s main purpose in doing the experiment is to test whether these sinful people will do the same mistake if given a chance to turn young again or not. And what this paper suggests as to what mistake is the love of physical beauty and admiration of what is only pleasant.  ;"

In regards to the SF/F split (what makes something Sci-Fi and what makes something Fantasy) I think it is not so clear. Casey mentions that maybe this is similar to the split between science and religion, that science attempts to explain how everything is done while religion looks at it with awe and wonder. While this is a good point to bring up, I respectfully disagree to an extent. For instance, there is a lot of awe and wonder in science and a lot of trying to explain the why and wherefores in religion (though typically through methods quite different than the scientific method).  I speculate here, but indulge me a bit...is the main difference between Sci-Fi and Fantasy that the former incorporates technology and the latter incorporate magic? Somebody brought up Frankenstein.

At first I was against the idea of an e-reader, but I'm travelling right now and carting around twenty pounds of books didn't sound like the best of ideas. Amazon has tons of free stuff, I even have a couple textbooks downloaded for GRE test preparation. At the moment I'm switching between  Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence, Symbolic Logic by Lewis Carroll, and The Grammar of English Grammars by Goold Brown.;Thanks for sharing, definitely sounds like an interesting read. Congrats on getting published!;They're definitely watching. Educated people are more difficult to control (particularly the people who find intrinsic worth in education). We might be safe in a literature class, but look out if you sign up for At Home Bombs 101 :P;Great analysis! Working in a similar vein I see a lot of the tales as a reflection of the inner workings of the individual. Like Abigail mentioned, most of the characters are fairly one dimensional and are only shown as being all bad or all good. In reality, people are multifaceted (good people sometimes do bad things and vice versa) and our concepts of good and bad are much more complex.In The Cat and Mouse Partnership the mouse is the industrious and prudent nature of the individual. She is the voice in everyone's head saying, ""We ought to save this for later."" The cat, on the other hand, is the irresponsible side of the individual; he takes the path of least resistance, lying when it suits him and interested only in instant gratification. At the end of the story when the cat devours the mouse it's as if the immoral, hedonistic side has taken over. Both aspects are manifested in many people's personalities and it is important to keep a healthy balance between the two. Too much indulgence can create an unproductive villain while too much focus on duties and responsibilities can make a person provincial and limited in outlook.;I take a less symbolic view and think the inclusion of royalty adds to the entertainment value. I think a lot of it has to do with using stories as a form of escapism, royalty is like their version of celebrity. It's typical of television today: People are obsessed with the rich and famous. Popular television constantly focuses on beautiful characters who live in nice houses (Desperate Housewives, Sex and the City, The Real Housewives of where ever) because people like to be taken away from their ordinary lives. Same as with Grimm's fairytales, we also enjoy seeing our celebrities self destruct and act immorally.;I don't think so. I know there was lots of speculation, but people often seek to demonize those who transcend our ideas of normal. Carroll was a strange guy. In one realm he was a bookish mathematician with a stutter and in another an author of delightfully silly fiction. He was close friends with a lot of children well into their adulthoods (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll/Child_friends_and_adult_friends);  some have even refuted the idea Carroll was ever inappropriate in his affections.;I think you're on to something here. Throughout the story Alice goes through many physical changes, even questions if she is still the same person she was when she began her journey. The them of the self being preserved through time is touched upon in many different ways. Time is a really slippery topic; we all have an understanding of time, but when questioned directly about what time really is (a thing, a property, a tool, a human invention?) many people are at a loss for words.""What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know."" --St. Augustine;I found this first essay pretty tough too! At first it seemed like each topic I chose was too broad or too obvious and I couldn't delve into it properly with the 320 word restraint. After re-writing the entire thing for the fourth time I decided even though it's not profound it's good enough and I hit submit. This first essay felt like a practice run to me; I think after we get them evaluated the next essays will be easier since we'll have a sense of what's expected.;"

Martin first of all presents morality as a subjective idea rather than a strict unwavering code.   His characters move through the world and as they do you see there core values and ideals change.   He also implies that a persons base sense of morality is shaped by many different outside forces such as religion, politics (or house loyalties), ethnicity, and culture.   These same views have never been more substantial than in todays modern world with our ideals of multi-culturalism and global citizenry.   It seems as our wold gets smaller Martin's world, and the realm of epic fantasy itself, is expanding and may eventually become as large a reality itself.;Hello Carol,I have read the entire series to date and I have to say Martin's style of narrative is one of the greatest of it's merits.   The focus on the individual players allows for the reader to not only learn to view Martin's world from the perspective of it's inhabitants, but also to understand the deeper motivations of the players actions.   This combination adds a drama element not traditionally present in fantasy that causes the reader to become more intensely immersed in the story.   I would even go as far as to say that Martin provides a new take on escapism.   ;James I have a theory about the shadowy magic system, which I will not go into detail on because you are not currently up to date with the series and I don't want to ruin it for anyone, that follows the line of thought that the essence of the supernatural elements in this series relates to the final outcome in such a way that to reveal the nature of how and why they occur before certain key events in the story would allow the reader too much insight into the conclusion.   However I would encourage you to read all of the volumes more than once because on my second read through I discovered that several small events, that seemed to be filler at first read, turned out to foreshadow major events (for example an understanding of the Frey's 'king of the crossing game' can mayhaps give insight into predicting their actions and motivations).;I had to check my free kindle store version against the text linked on the course page the translations are very different and some of the titles didn't match at all.

It seems like they get the most boring sounding people on purpose.;'1984' and 'Brave New World' are studied together probably more than any other two books in the genre as they essentially present two sides of the same coin and have elements that closely represent modern society. In the Information Age '1984' is relevant to the social climate in parts of Asia and the Middle East, as in these areas heavy censorship and tight control of media are prevalent. Conversely Huxley's 'Brave New World' is representative of the social climates of Western Europe and North America where we are flooded with so much information through free media that creates essentially the same effect as the aforementioned censorship.

In 'A Scanner Darkly' the main actors are hidden from perception by technology that conceals them by overloading the senses with too much information, distracting from the truth of what is hidden beneath, and thereby mirroring the perception of the protagonist.   In 'Minority Report' we are introduced to a world that is presented as entirely deterministic however, later we discover this may not be the fact. In 'Total Recall' we don't know what memories we can trust.   In all cases it's not what we see that makes the story, it's what we don't see.   In the same way It's not what the author says in his novels the we need to pay close attention to, it's what he doesn't say. Do androids dream of electric sheep? Do dreams indicate the presence of a soul? It's never clearly stated but it's implied, and its that implication that shapes our perception and allows us to accept the possibility of the impossible.;I think it sometimes you just don't hit the nail.

It was about a sense of belonging and feeling part of a nation. Many Germanic peoples were subject to rule by others - such as those under the Austro-Hungarian (Habsburg) empire. The same is the case for Italy. Both Italy and Germany became countries in their own right in the late nineteenth century so the Grimm Tales are just part of the art created in this period that reflected a national pride and a sense of 'German-ness' before the creation of an actual German state.   It is easy with the benefit of hindsight and what we know of the horrors of National Socialism under the Nazis to credit the Grimm Tales with a different agenda to what they originally had. This is dangerous ground and we need to understand stories in the context in which they were written. Of course it's equally valid to look at the influence of stories on future generations and this is where the morals and politics of the time of reading (such as when Nazis were gaining ground) would come into play.I think nationalism has gained a negative connotation, largely due to right wing extremists such as the Nazis, but it's important to remember that it also means patriotism and loyalty to one's country and this is probably closer to the original meaning of the word at the time the Grimm Brothers were writing.  ;"

I am shashi from Hyderabad. Currently in California. This is my first class ever with coursera. Please count me in. Looking forward for you support. Thank you so very much.;No I'd say that's precisely on the topic! An an excellent point. The presence of Sci-Fi all around makes Sci-Fi itself become more derivative of ... itself.;That's a very good point, the cart has been put before the horse, as it were.;I would agree that this is dipping dangerously close to Hard v. Soft Sci-Fi. I find it interesting that Gar noted Sci-Fi taking technology of today or soon-to-be today, and explore ramifications. It seems to me that the pivotal difference between today's Sci-Fi and that of yester-year (1950's) was that they used to employ the method of finding a new and interesting problem, and imagining the kind of technology that might solve that problem. The Science part of the Fiction seemed much more imaginative because of the abundance of problems yet to be solved.;I would argue that there's a strong difference between fictionalizing fantasy science, and actually creating new science. The explanations some people want would be found much more at home within the pages of a scientific journal. They want every question answered with solid realities, which takes a story right out of Fiction altogether.For magic, the person who comes to mind is Penn Jillette. He mostly does know how magic works (and a whole lot of other things), yet still enjoys watching somebody perform. He enjoys it because if it's done well enough, it can bring back his disbelief (in Magic, disbelief is a good thing) for a moment.It seems to me that it's okay to give as vague an explanation as to say that the method used to communicate instantly across the globe involves wires, or relays or something (clearly with a nod to the 50's). I think Sci-Fi absolutely could do with a little more fantasy, and a little less attempt at being Science itself. Sci-Fi is there to come up with the ideas, not the actual working technologies.;I, for one, am deterred by a book if the bulk of a sci-fi novel is filled with detailed descriptions of the technology. Tell me what I need to know to understand why it's important to the story - but more than that is just showing off.Yes, the author should have thought about it. In depth. That's part of the writer's job.  But - there are several authors I no longer read because, although their stories are interesting, they seem to be too invested in making sure the reader knows ""I did my research."" It bogs down a story for me....;In my view, the narrative, plot, characters and world-building is the entirety of a story. In Sci-Fi, the fictional (though often plausible) science is a part of each of those. The Narrative has to be done well enough that it isn't bogged down with too much information, but that it does adequately explain what's going on and tells its story. The Plot has to necessitate the technologies, or they become nothing but a gimmick for show. The Characters have a certain set of knowledge, which is sometimes expansive (Star Trek) and sometimes they know next to nothing (Philip K. Dick's writings usually); either way, they have to be able to express themselves through the story, and not be relegated to names and faces attached to a technical manual. The World-building seems most important of all; if you were to read a book like Snow Crash and the world-building was not done well enough, you would have nothing to visualize and might not understand the reasons for the technologies they are using. World-Building, in my view, is what happens when the other factors are done perfectly.;Well in six soldiers of fortune none of the men were of a particularly high social class, yet the leader was still lucky in the sense that he found comrades to help him and they were able to trick the king and become rich, but then again none of them were ""heros"" so maybe I'm wrong. Anyways, I think your thesis is insightful and I'm going to re-read all of the Tales and make sure I pay attention to the social hierarchy.;mmm... I think it could be a reflect of that era. I mean, fairy tales work as mirrows of the social status of women and men on those years.;Praduymn, hahah, your comment made me laugh, I like how you twisted the sense.  And I totally agree with you on the theatricality bit. The exact salary is of little importance, I believe. What matters is the descendent (Or is it descendant? sorry there) value of his possesions.  ;This is great! I was wondering why the frog didn't splat against the wall when it was thrown by the princess ...(using my high school physics f=ma  -- I was pretty sure that a frog wouldn't survive).;What happens to f=ma (force equals mass times  accelleration)  when the mass suddenly increases from a one-pound frog to a 150-pound prince?   If we hold the force constant, there's a rapid decelleration and he floats harmlessly to the ground. But if we hold the accellertion constant, there's a  150-fold increase in force and he probably does get splattered.;According to Wikipedia, the European common frog, rana temporaria, weighs 22.7g (0.8 ounces) on average, so I was overestimating by quite a bit. Let's imagine our prince to be five-foot-ten--tall for his time but not freakishly so--and of an ideal weight to be considered handsome and athletic. There are several models in use to determine ideal weight:The J.D. Robinson formula (52 kg + 1.9 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  156.5 lbsThe D.R. Miller formula (56.2 kg + 1.41 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  155.0 lbsThe B.J. Devine  formula (50.0kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  160.9  lbsThe G.J. Hamwi formula (48.0 kg + 2.7 kg per inch over 5 feet) yields an ideal weight of  165.3 lbsI don't know which is best, so I will take an average: 159.4 lbs.  So turning from frog to prince has increased his mass by 3188 times. Let's just say he's about 3200 times more massive than before.How fast can a princess throw a frog weighing eight tenths of an ounce? I don't know, but women's fast-pitch softball throws can be clocked at up to 75 miles per hour. Granted, the princess is not a trained athlete, and a frog is not very aerodynamic, but the frog would weigh considerably less than a 6.25- to 7-ounce softball. Personally, I'd allow her a 25 to 30 mph frog-pitch.Splat!;I'd wager that the odds aren't actually in favor of my statement.

As in, remember stories where the soon-to-be-killed hero would switch (or be switched) with another person/object? The story of Zeus and Cronos comes to mind. So, the Switch + The Unknown Bride = The Bride and Switch.Your post has got me thinking... Sure its a valid plot point, but why the constant recurrence? ;Hmmm... You're right.

I can see the humor in it, and I can see the literary importance - but I just can't get myself to actually enjoy a single one of their writings.;This is all making me wonder about how people in early 19th c. rural Germany conceptualised ""luck"". I know that the concept of individual identity was quite different in some ways, so was ""luck"" more like the modern notion of random chance or the idea of ""luck"" as an inherent quality you carry about with you (which was prevalent in my neck of the woods, and still continues with the idea that a person can be innately ""lucky"").Not very helpful. Just mulling.;I think that luck itself plays an extremely important role in most of the fairy tales. Like, even if luck is not directly mentioned, a person can be lucky by being cunning and intelligent (like in clever Gretel, six soldiers of fortune, and the rabbits bride) Gretel is lucky because she doesn't get caught due to her intelligence, and the six soldiers use their skills to outsmart the king which is complete luck in itself that they all came together. Also the maiden in The Rabbits Bride is lucky that she was able to trick the rabbit and return home. Luck also plays roles in many stories of heroism, and the like.;One of my favorite editions of ""Household Tales"" begins with an introduction by A.S. Byatt and she does a fabulous job of outlining what makes these tales so enduring. That introduction is well worth the read. ;OK;Rebecca, that is really insightful. We tend to lump the Grimm collection together as ""fairy tales"", and because fairy tales have become morality tales, it's hard to get round our expectations of what the Tales were at the time.  ;What I think is interesting is that there's so much scope for acting out these tales, as Anahita mentioned in relation to her grandmother. They're so succinct and spared of detailed description that they make the imagination work really hard and that provides huge artistic licence when it comes to taking it from the book and back to oral tradition where it came from. I think the point about patterns is a good one, especially when we look at the tales from an oral perspective. It's like in the Odyssey where there are set phrases that repeat again and again.  ;As I said, much argument in many directions. I thought it an interesting perspective, in current times as well with LOTR and Song of Fire and Ice (Lewis obviously used symbols from his tradition, yet still honored ancient motifs)...it's nice to know that the old themes still ring true.In terms of Disney, he was speaking mainly of Fantasia, the use of having Mickey as an apprentice to a Sorcerer, he contrasted that with books that had been banned at the time for obvious witchcraft symbolism...;I love that you figured this out.

The retribution the six soldiers get would be well suited for a retelling from a modern veteran's point of view.;Cheri, I think you've hit the nail on the head for me, thank you - Irish tales have depth of character (and, often, development of character). Even if you look across versions, the Fionn from the Salmon of Knowledge tale is not quite the same Fionn from the Giant's Causeway tale - and not just because he can access greater knowledge by sucking his thumb. He has grown and developed in that time. There is a sense of forward momentum.Karen, your point about the greater development of Irish tales is well taken. If there is a difference between the Grimm tales and Irish tales in that respect though, I would suggest that it's more due to *cultural* underpinnings than historical ones. My ancestry is not terribly distantly German and Irish, and I have noticed that my German relations tend to tell their folktales the same way each time - small details may differ, but on the whole, it is the same tale. That's not a criticism - consistency across versions may well be why the Grimms were able to compile the tales in the first place. Irish culture, on the other hand, encourages the storyteller to make the story their own. There are as many distinct versions of Cuchulainn/Setanta as there are people who know his stories - and more. There are some versions which feel like heresy (and which ones those are will differ from person to person) and everyone is convinced that only *they* know the ""right"" ones. I *have* encountered that with Grimm and other germanic tales, but not often. I have also heard Irish storytellers tell ""their versions"" drastically differently on two different nights, because ""the night is different, so the story must be, too."" (Woody Guthrie made many similar statements over the years regarding his music.) This aspect of Irish folktales sounds very romantic, but it can often be very *frustrating* - a close friend of the family once told the best version of Children of Lir I've ever heard, and he's not repeated it since. Not because he doesn't want to (although that may be true), but he literally doesn't remember it. So, I'm stuck with hazy memories of a particular night when I was 12, and a particular version I loved, don't remember the details of, and can never hear again... but, my friend points out, am I not better for hearing it the once?Irish culture *embraces* the transientness and individuality of oral storytelling with an enthusiasm unlike any other culture I know of. The most important part of the story is the experience of hearing it - the words are seen as the vehicle, not the destination.That's not to say the Irish have cornered the market on that notion - I have known fantastic storytellers of all nationalities. But the Irish have a sort of cultural endorsement at their backs, that of *course* everyone's story will always be different and of *course* there is no one ""proper"" tale - just the right tale for the right experience on the right night with the right people. This notion goes all the way back to the social position of the bards in Ancient Irish culture - the bard was second in status only to the King, because the bard held all the history.On Irish Nationalism and Home Rule - I could write a thread's worth of posts on that, but they'd be outside the scope of this course, and I don't want to bore anyone to death. :) I will say you're correct to a certain degree - if you look at very early versions of Irish fairytales, they are less romanticized than the ones we tell now. However, they are less different than you'd think. With the caveat that I do not *speak* Sean-Ghaeilge (the kind of Irish we're talking about if you're going that far back in history, pre-Home Rule) I speak enough Modern Irish to have puzzled out pieces of the early written versions. (There are also still a bare handful of Sean-Ghaeilge scholars who are busily translating everything they can get their hands on into Irish and English before those manuscripts are lost to us - their work has been invaluable to me in my poking around.) That's not to say that the history of Ireland hasn't affected the stories... that would be an impossible and ridiculous claim to make. Morgan Llwellyn is probably one of the best known authors who retells the old tales through an oft (but not always) Republican/Nationalist lens, and is a good author to check out if you want to compare those retellings to other ones. But it's important to remember that, as with the Germanic tales, Irish tales so predate written language that the people who tell them tend to resist allowing political machinations to make much of a dent in the way they tell the story.;Jacob (Isaac's son) fell victim to the bride and switch, yes, but it was never put right the way the Grimms' stories do: the sisters were bitter rivals, and the competition for sons got pretty ugly, right down to sending their servants in for Jacob to impregnate.;Don't be ridiculous.   *Everyone* at Michigan is cute.But I was more interested in knowing who we should be paying close attention to in the forum.;In Grimm, the tails of furry woodland creatures seem to be a popular mode of transportation, even for male protagonists.

Now, you can pick and choose the sin- kids shows on the Disney channel are light on drug abuse and physical violence, but they substitute plenty of relational aggression- or you can be very delicate in your depiction of sin.   But there has to be sin to make the plot go.

The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart. (a very clever book. You'll enjoy it.)3. The Giver by Lois Lowry (a must read.)4.

It's so funny!- I'm seconding the recommendation of A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle. That whole series is amazing. - I also loved the His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman as already mentioned. -  Someone briefly mentioned The Chronicles of Narnia. I just reread all those books and I'd recommend just reading The Magician's Nephew. It's lesser known but really good storytelling and imagination. You'll see.;""Hans in Luck"" is the story of a boy who worked seven years for a lump of gold, but on the walk home to his mother traded it for a horse, traded the horse for the cow, and kept making trades until he only had a rock that he dropped. When I was reading this tale I thought it must be a story with a strong moral of the dangers of squandering your money.  Yet...the moral never came. The ending is ambiguous, and Hans is still happy. The reader doesn't know what will happen and can only guess how his mother will react when he gets home.  So then I thought that this must be a story about how you can be happy.  But no reader would want to follow Hans' example! We can see that Hans is so dumb to trade away all his possessions and be happy while he does it. Is the point of the story really that ""If you're really dumb, you can be happy no matter what""? What do you think the 'point' of this story is?;I remember that poem! I'm starting to think that that's all this story is about too, at least on the surface.;This is an interesting interpretation. Now that you mention how the stones weigh him down, it seems that each possession Hans comes by has a drawback   - the horse runs away, the cow doesn't give milk, etc, etc.  However, there are several things in the story which disagree with your interpretation. First, Hans is very happy from the beginning and doesn't seem to change as a character. And secondly, Hans WANTED the horse, cow, pig, etc very much. He desired the possessions because he didn't have them and thought they would make him happy, and once he had them he didn't want them, which seems to suggest ""The grass is greener on the other side."" To go with your interpretation, I guess you could say Hans is gradually losing his desire for any material possessions so in that way he does change. Kind of like a rich person who, after having everything, realizes things can't bring happiness.I think that relating this story to the creation story is a bit of a stretch, but I'll agree that 7 is a magical and spiritual number. So Hans is going on a spiritual journey of a kind. Very interesting! Thanks for sharing your thoughts.;When you put it that way, you're exactly right. It seems happiness depends on your perspective.Maybe this story is about how you can't judge others based on what you would have done because everyone is different. Grimm definitely seems to be playing with the reader's expectations and having a bit of a joke because the reader might think ""Oh no! Hans has given away 7 years of hard work!"" but Hans is happy about all his decisions.;Like so many others, nothing really inspired me...I was drawn to stories from the beginning. I believe children naturally are, and this inclination just has to be nurtured by teachers and parents. I've been a preschool teacher, and I love reading to groups of kids, and watching all of them be completely spellbound by the story. They are so into it! They eat it up! They can't get enough! I'm sure you've seen this yourself. People naturally love a good story.The real question should be: what inspired you to keep reading, to be a lifelong reader? For, so many people as they get older just get 'too busy' to read and put reading low on their priorities list after work, relationships, tv, money, whatever else it may be. But we all know how important reading actually is.  For me, I'm an introvert and more shy and reserved by nature. So growing up, reading was a way for me to live vicariously through characters. To explore far off lands and have adventures without having to leave the house. My mom encouraged my reading habit and we made regular trips to the library (she loves to read too). I was highly imaginative and reading fostered that creative and curious side of me. That's why growing up I loved fantasy and still continue to today.  ;I think that you need to approach this course and the stories themselves with an open mind. If you stop after the first story you'll miss some great ones. I am reading the stories a bit at a time and some are delightful, some are thought-provoking, some are strange, some are bizarre, and all of them have more to them than what's on the surface. I am finding them fun to read! So I'd urge you to give it another try. When you signed up for this course you did so to learn, as you have stated. But if you give up so quickly, how can you expect to learn? I personally was able to get the stories onto my kindle following the ""Send to Kindle"" link on this page. So I'd urge you to try again.;I just submitted mine. I liked the small word count. It forced me to be concise and simple with my writing. My essay was originally twice as long and I was able to shorten it. I am relieved that I was able to fit the word count and still make my point.High fives to those that are finished. And good luck if you're still writing! Don't worry about it too much.  ;Inspired by some of the discussions in the threads, I've been thinking about the themes in the Brothers Grimm and how we relate to them today. There are so many themes in these stories to talk about.Which themes are still alive in our culture today? These still feel relevant and we see them in movies, books, and throughout. They may look a little different now, but we can recognize them in the Brothers Grimm.  For example: The Cinderella motif. A mousy, outsider girl undergoes a transformation and gets the man of her dreams. I think we can all agree that we still love this idea and see it in many romance movies and books (even though we do away with other parts of the story).Which themes, on the other hand, are ""dead""? To us they might feel old and antiquated and we may even be angered by them.  For example: The theme of ""Staying in your Place"". In many Grimm stories the poor peasant who tries to be more than that is punished. These stories are from a more regimented society. In our democratic world, we prefer ""rags to riches"" stories instead, when a man who was poor becomes a millionaire. In fact if someone went around going ""The poor should stay poor and the rich should stay rich"" he'd probably get shot!Okay, your turn!  ;Some very good points! I think that the repetition draws out the story and builds the suspense. If there were no repetition the stories would be shorter and resolved quicker and just wouldn't be as interesting. The repetition makes you keep reading to see what will happen that third time.  You follow along with the story better, having some idea what will happen next, and having it happen 3 times seems to raise the stakes. Also there's something very pleasing about the pattern and repetition, like a song that repeats a catchy chorus. I agree that children like repetition and you see it in many children's books because it works.  ;I agree, it's really hard to swallow reading it now! Back then it was the norm for women to be treated like property or prizes to be won but I find it pretty terrible. Definitely, women had less rights, less of a say, and were thought of as lesser creatures in that time. Even though they certainly worked hard (spinning, cooking, cleaning, etc) and men were dependent on them!I have been thinking about the fact that all beautiful women in the stories are virtuous and good and the ugly women are evil or petty. So even back then all women were expected to be beautiful, and if they were not they were nothing! I imagine everyone would be nice to beautiful women but scorn ugly women and so their personalities would be influenced by that. So an ugly woman hated by society would turn bitter and jealous inside, and the stereotype would perpetuate.  There are definitely recurring character tropes in the Brothers Grimm. They were probably common characters in society's imagination. They seem to be shortcuts that made it easy for the Grimm brothers to write the stories. They didn't have to explain a character's personality. They just had to say 'beautiful princess' or 'mean step-mother' or 'youngest brother' or 'old king' and everyone could imagine what they were talking about so they could get on with the story.;"

It's true that in the past technology was limited and even simple things like cell phones and even in some cases computers seemed liked it was truly out there. Science or better the honest pursuit of truth is limited by reality, But science fiction is the imagination of science and it is only limited by the authors imagination. I think that the more truth we discover the more room we make for some truly imaginative science fiction.   Science fiction grows with true science.

The problem I ran into was that either they didn't have the book I was looking for, or they had multiple versions and I couldn't tell which one I needed. And you're right -- it would get pretty expensive. However, I have a terrible audio book habit already, and part of me doesn't mind feeding it with classics for a class. The trick is making sure that I'm getting the same electronic copy as the audio copy I'm listening too, so I can look up quotes and references later. Audio books are much easier on my eyes, but more difficult for me to take notes with. And no page numbers, of course. :D;Similarly, I would call ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" a dystopian SF, but ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"" by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden's Tale.Thinking about it, though it was clunky in places, the thing that really delighted me about The Fifth Sacred Thing was the tension between the imperfect yet Utopia-seeking community of the north which focuses on co-operation, equality, and non-violence, and the Dystopian, rigidly stratified theocracy in the south - and the fact that it was through non-violent means that the southern forces were either repelled or persuaded to defect. It's really rare to have creative non-violent protagonists win the day.  Though Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is set in the aftermath of the so-called ""terrorist attack"" which involved some kind of biological weaponry, it's always struck me as more along the speculative fiction-fantasy area of the spectrum than sci-fi, as there's no real discussion of that or other technology.

I'm just not a fan of the idea that we need to categorise books this way. Kids will read to their own level, and adults will tend to steer clear of some truly cook books that are labelled YA. My discovery of the YA shelves was by accident, and I've found a load of books there that are just as clever, witty, thought provoking and absorbing as anything in the ""adult"" SF&F shelves. There are books on the ""adult"" shelves that have adolescent protagonists, and books on the ""YA"" shelves with adult protagonists. The categorisation seems entirely random.So nowadays I look at the YA shelves as well.  ;Kim, have you tried any Tanith Lee?   Also, I agree on Tamora Pierce and Jane Yolen as phenomenal writers.   Pierce's books make fantastic audio books for commutes.I read Mists of Avalon in 3rd grade (hey, I was bored and needed something to read), so by the time I stumbled across Heinlein in middle school I was a little less shocked at the sexy times and more going ""ewww"" at the incest.   Most avid readers in about the same age group as myself that I've talked to jumped from kids books to Anne Rice or Anne McCaffrey (I went the Pern route myself), we didn't really have access to ""YA"" books.   That being said I read a large number of ""YA"" titles and found some are just put there b/c they are PG in content (no graphic sex or profanity), and others are put there because they focus on teen characters often with a teen audience in mind... however if some of them are very graphic (The House of Night series doesn't shy away from teen's getting on).Confession time, I judge a library by if they have a dedicated SciFi/Fantasy section.   I'm a librarian and I still do this.   Why?   Because I know exactly where to go if I have no clue what to read and grab something random off the shelf.   Since my current library pulled the SciFi and Fantasy out of the main stacks into their own section their circulation stats have skyrocketed, so I must not be the only one.;Speculative Fiction is a meta category, but that doesn't stop Utopian/Distopian fiction from being speculative.;Fair enough.   I have to side on the ""it could be either"" argument - in part depending on the concept of the utopia or distopia.   In my own digital bookshelving (mostly on Booklikes these days, only adding books I've reviewed on Goodreads now) I have an shelf/tag for distopia that often is paired with sci-fi or with fantasy, and sometimes with neither.   I think I tend for more overlap with Science Fiction rather than Fantasy due to the number of books that use the folly of man combined with technology as the vehicle to explore distopian settings (or alternatively, used to explore how we could improve).   When you add in the post-apocalypse setting to distopian often the crisis is triggered by technology.   S. M. Stirling novels of the Change (Dies the Fire, etc) are based on fantasy but are more post-apocalyptic event rather than specifically utopia/distopian. Phillip K. Dick's distopian fiction, or Heinlein's utopian fiction are pretty solidly based in a sci-fi setting.;It strikes me as a smart move. So many people avoid certain genres because they're unfamiliar, or because they have ideas about SF&F being for ""nerds"", or literary fiction being ""difficult"". I am definitely guilty of doing that at times. Yet the best moments are when you pick up a book you'd never have gone for but for mis-shelving and discover that it's marvellous in its own right.;I forgot.

BUT, it is much, much easier to ""sin by omission,"" to stand by and do nothing (or be unaware and oblivious) while another person dies.   In The Hunger Games, remember that most of Katniss' ""kills"" are indirect.   SPOILERs: - She mentions that there was one set of games where the children simply sat around and starved to death.   It was considered the most boring games ever, so the arena-masters added ""features"" to prevent it from happening again.- She drops the tracker jacker nest on one crowd of children, and lets them die by wasp sting- She waits on the cornucopia all night, while the muttations slowly kill the last enemy childI'm sure there are other examples./SPOILERSI'll second what the above poster said.

Kim - I have a couple of anthropologist friends who've taught me that assumptions about graves and grave goods, ""hunter gatherer societies"", and so on in the public consciousness are way behind what's going on in academia. One of them told me a brilliant story one of her lecturers told her about 20 years ago about visiting a remote tribe in an African nation. She discovered that ideas about their social structure and the emphasis on hunting were totally wrong and asked why. It turned out that the people realised that the white men who'd come to see them in years past had firm views about how they lived, and weren't interested in anything that didn't fit that pattern, so they gave up and just ""told them what they wanted to hear"", in part just to get rid of them.

I know it's hard to ask.;It's hard to say.I was initially trained in a very formal (5-paragraph) essay format, in which one would NEVER use the word ""I"" in an essay about literatureThen I changed schools, and suddenly everyone wanted to know what I thought and what I felt.   I held on to the habit, though, and even got in trouble as an undergrad because my report on my internship never said what ""I"" did :)As an M.A. student, though, the ""I think"" and ""I feel"" was allowed, even (or perhaps especially) when writing about literature.But also review the video on writing expectations.   ""I think"" and ""I feel"" don't lend themselves readily to a 270-320 word thesis on the book.   In a short paragraph like that, I would consider the phrases to be extraneous and unnecessary.   Of course this thesis tells what you think.;You can miss two essays and still get a certificate of completion.I've been in at least one and sometimes two grad school classes since January, and this weekend was finishing my last major assignment.   Between that, work, family, etc, I've been just slightly short on sleep for about 6 months now.   This is a light concluding week, and next week will be my one week off before my next summer class starts.   I decided to start catching up on sleep Monday instead of doing my Grimm essay.I plan to catch up and do an essay for Week 2, and will try to keep up after that.   (I may post a late Grimm essay in the discussion forum.)I do agree that Dracula is not a book I am eager to read.   My husband tried to watch the Bram Stroker's Dracula movie with me once in college, I made him turn it off in about 10 minutes.   That's very unusual for me.   While I don't like horror and rarely choose to watch it, with a group I've usually been able to stick it out.;I have placed my one completed MOOC on my resume.I agree with the ""do your best and forget the rest.""   I discovered I didn't have the programming language to complete my first Coursera listing.   I might retake it at a later date.   I hope to complete this one, but as I said in my intro, my graded classes take precedence.;Please, listen to Emma.   She's got it.One of the things I learned during my Humanities graduate coursework, is that NORMALLY (I had one professor who was an exception) the wrong answer is one that is a) incoherent or b) not supported by the evidence.;Oh good.

I think it's important to discuss these issues as adults, and even in secondary schools with adolescents.   I do have concerns with younger children.My son has inherited several of his grandfather's books, that we currently keep out of reach.   Some of them include archaic stories of things that I do not believe are okay.   Under my first premise (read for discussion of the issues around adolescence or later), I'm currently storing them out of reach & out of sight of my 5-yr-old.And yet, and yet.   Is it privilege that lets me wait, and not talk to him about these things yet?;And I read The Left Hand of Darkness *twice* in high school, and don't even remember the gender shifts.   It will be interesting to read it again now.;I came into the course knowing that Grimm's Household Tales were not pretty stories for children.  Even the Disney adaptations contain cruelty, if not on this scale.  I grew up knowing the story of Little Red Riding Hood (as Red Cap is known where I am), I knew that the wolf ate people up. To the original poster, I would advise not continuing the course.  If you think that the Grimm tales are bad, then Dracula, Poe, and The Invisible Man are much worse.  I am not a horror fan at all.  I've done all right with Poe in written form, but most video adaptations take it a step further than I'm comfortable with.  Still, horror is part of our imagination. You ask how we handle it.  I handle Grimm through separation - ""It's just a story, it's not real.""  I agree with you that many of the punishments are horrible.  The sad part is, many of the things that happened, while fictionalized, have their roots in true human experiences.  Fairy Tales are rarely sweetness and light. ;I didn't ""get"" Alice as a child.   I enjoyed the poem Jabberwocky, and also memorized at least portions of it, but that's about it.I have seen Alice imagery in multiple places, from the Disney adaptation to the Muppet Show, to even Star Trek.   Many scientists have adopted the plays on words from Alice's adventures to describe the things they find, so that is another avenue that makes the stories worth reading for me.;Was anybody else reminded of the Angry Birds' Bad Piggies when they saw the ""green pigs"" translation?Or am I just weird like that?;"

However, I also don't think it would have to correspond exactly with MLA or other recognized citation style.;I learned it as a fun little nonsense poem.   Some of the words from the poem (gymbal comes to mind) have been adopted in the scientific community.But if you want a word-by-word explanation Alice repeats the poem towards the end of the book, and each word is explained to her.   I believe there's another thread on this forum that uses the translated words.;Keep in mind that most ""Modern Art"" was created in the early to middle 20th century.   Pablo Picasso lived from 1881 to 1973.   Salvador Dali lived from 1904 to 1989.   Many of their most famous works were created in the 1930's.   We're already past the ""Postmodern"" era of art.In addition to the choice to go with copyright-free material, I think the works that were selected still have a bearing on the world we live in today.   If you recall the lectures on Grimm, and how the Grimm brothers were working to bring about this idea of Germany as a nation... something that England and France had already done by the era of Joan of Arc (as learned from a Great Lectures course, ""Medieval Heroines in History and Legend"").   The rise of Germany as a nation was pivotal to 20th century history, with not one but two World Wars.I'm old enough to remember the 1980s and some of the later Nazi trials, and in particular the concept that ""Just following orders"" is not a valid justification for performing horrible acts of cruelty.   The two World Wars carried into the Cold War that lasted until about 1990.   Even 23 years later, the world is still adjusting to the realities of a post-Cold War era, the fall of the Soviet Union as a superpower... and the waking of China from isolationism to resume activity in world affairs.So much happens between the 17th century and today that are unprecedented in human history.;Oxana,Here is the link to the Great Courses webpage for that lecture series:  http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=2937I was able to check it out from my local library, as a set of audio recordings on CD (it may be as many as 48 CDs long).   I played the recordings in my car on my commutes.   If you are interested in women in history and/or the medieval era, then I think it's worth your time to listen to them.   I definitely enjoyed the lectures and learned a great deal.   However, for a 19-year-old, I am not certain it is worth the $$$ to buy your own copy.As the link indicates, the lectures discuss Eloise and Abelard, Hildegard of Bingen, Eleanor of Aquitane, Queen of England and France, and Joan of Arc.   I remember the comparison that in Eleanor's time, there wasn't a concept of France or England as distinct nations.   But that had changed by Joan's time.;I discussed this with some friends of mine who enjoyed B-rated horror movies.   The wife was Jewish, and explained that the concept of vampires is inherently Christian.If I understand her perspective properly, kosher meat is drained from blood.   Also, if I understand correctly, hallal meat is handled in a similar manner.   Both practices are an indication that drinking blood is anathema to both Jewish and Muslim beliefs.However, as has already been discussed here, the Catholic mystery of communion proclaims that the bread and wine are transformed into the Body & Blood of Christ. This is true for both the Byzantine rites (Greek & Russian Orthodox) and Roman Catholics.   Protestant beliefs on the subject vary widely.I do agree with David Grigg that the tools against vampires (crucifixes, the host) do seem to be equally effective for non-Christians.   There's an amusing moment in Buffy the Vampire Slayer when they have to uninvite a vampire from Willow Rosenberg's house, by nailing crosses beside the door.   Willow expresses concern over what her Jewish parents would think.The literature on vampires varies widely with regard to their powers and limitations.   In the case of Buffy, they had the vampires turn to dust in order to limit the number of bodies lying around during filming.;"

Both discuss terrorism and also betrayal.I'll do my best below to describe the two characters well enough to distinguish who they are without spoiling major plot points.   In one movie, the events are within the first 20 minutes.   In the other movie, the motivating background is not revealed until very late in the movie.Both Iron Man 3 and ST:ID include at least two traitor figures.   The two I am comparing betray their responsibilities in order to protect their daughters.   In ST:ID, the traitor is given a very slight sympathetic treatment.   His daughter was actually dying of some disease, his opportunity is to cure her completely, and just before he fulfills his end of the deal, he sends off a message telling who, what, and why.   The traitor of Iron Man 3 has none of these sympathetic elements.   I can't help comparing and contrasting these two characters with a recent public figure.I also found the Iron Man 3 use of the ""Mandarin"" character to be a wry political commentary.;The wolf that Dracula borrows in order to break the glass and remove the garlic from Lucy's window.;I did wonder, when I saw the professor's e-mail, about the children captivated by ""the bloofer lady"".   It is true that they are not named... There seems to be a class (and possibly age) issue, since I gathered that the children (both the kidnapped and killed child in Transylvania and the injured children in London) were low-class peasants.   They were never named because they didn't ""count"" as people.I found it interesting that I saw a reference to a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.   For the curious, the children's rights and anti-child abuse movement arose out of the Animal protection movement, in the 19th century.   From what I have read so far, that seems to be after the Dracula era.;At least one legend has Athena sprung full-grown from Jupiter's head, and often displayed ""man-brain"";These are good thoughts, and add to my comments in the ""no children in Dracula.""The children shown so far (I'm still on the hunt on the continent) have been working class at best.    I saw implications that the children bitten by ""miss bloofey"" were likely beggars, or just barely better.   And so they don't ""count"" as people, or characters.The wolf, Berserker, gets named and his kidnapping described, but these children are kept anonymous, unknown, barely-there figures.;I also am not participating in the writing portion *this* cycle.   As I said in my introduction, I am trying to focus my efforts on my job and my graded graduate-level class.I was hoping that I might fit essays into my schedule, but now that I have missed three it's too late to earn the certificate. I'm still going to attempt to read along with the class.   I am not a slow reader, but life is interfering so that I am finishing the books a little late.  I also would not have tackled this reading list if it were not for this course.   Horror stories are not my cup of tea, I've read too many that ended on terrifying notes rather than hopeful.   So I was surprised to find myself really getting into Dracula late in the book, curious about what happened. And yet I think I shouldn't have been surprised, as there are very few books I've read for school assignments that I did not come to appreciate.I am enjoying the discussion forums and conversing about the books.   I'm going to focus on the positive, and learn what I can.;Hi Laurie,I appreciate the concern, but I'm not that interested this year.

I wonder if JKRowling was familiar with that story. ;Re: Christian influence on the tales' morals, I definitely saw a parallel between the beheading of the twins in Faithful John and the God's command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac in Genesis. Personally I find it morally inexcusable to kill a child in either case, but it does make sense within a values system that exalts faith and obedience to a higher power above all else. In Faithful John, all of the King's prior problems had been caused by his reluctance to trust John's word. I think it entirely possible that John is a stand in for the Judeo-Christian god in this story. ;They are incredibly sanitized in many cases--- I believed for most of my life that the Grimm's stories were the Real Original Thing-- and about the darkest versions of the tales you were going to get. I was in for quite a surprise when I traced the history of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" -- it is taken from a much older tale in which the princess is raped in her sleep by a married king and only awakens months later after unconsciously delivering his twins. When she goes to find him, his jealous wife tries to boil her alive in oil... I was a bit taken aback to say the least. ;Definitely... Desirability is subjective. A bottle of water is worth more than a million dollars if you haven't had a drink in days. Hans figures out what he needs at the moment, and is willing to give it up when it no longer applies... I can think of a lot of people who hoard things they don't need because they might want them again someday, and all those things eventually become a burden to take care of, much like Han's stones. ;I had the same reaction... I started out irritated by the story but by the end was very charmed by it.  ;I don't think it matters that Hans never explicitly states this philosophy. Fairy tale characters often simply embody a certain trait or virtue, without breaking down exactly why they are doing what they're doing for the audience. ;I remember another similar Grimm's story that I don't think is in our reading (though I'm only 3/4 of the way through), where the Father cuts off his daughter's hands in order to get out of a deal he'd made with the devil. Now I'm wondering if the mutilation of daughters, specifically their hands, is a common element in folk tales... ;I agree with some of the posts here suggesting that there is an element of budding sexuality/puberty at play in the girl's decision to go with the rabbit. Because of their excessive fertility, rabbits have long been used to represent a vital sex drive ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_and_hares_in_art ). However, the same vitality and passion that can make one an appealing sex partner can also sometimes fuel aggressive and temperamental behavior (his bullying of the girl). ;Interesting... I hadn't even thought about the symbolism of the cabbage patch before. I was too focused on the rabbit. :-) That ties a lot of these themes together very neatly right from from the start- if the rabbit represents the male and the cabbage patch represents the female, and the first thing we learn in the story is that the mother fears that rabbit is a danger to the cabbage patch... ;Taking a little inspiration from the Bride and Switch thread here, I also wanted to talk about a TvTrope I was reminded of when reading The Brother And Sister-  No Ontological Inertia http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia It references, among other things, the preponderance of stories that involve spells breaking once the original spellcaster is gone- ie the fawn becoming human again once the witch is executed. This is definitely not the first time I've seen a fairy tale appeal to this rule of magic, and I was wondering why. Is it just a convenient plot device to secure a happy ending, or is there a deeper significance? Anyway, I just wanted to open the floor to opinions because I wasn't really sure myself... I did have a sort of fuzzy idea that it was related to religion in some way- there are lots of stories going back to the ancient world showing God/the gods putting constant effort into keeping the world running on a day to day basis (Apollo's daily chariot ride, for example)- and that maybe magic is supposed to work in a similar way to divine power. But I don't know. ;It wouldn't be the first time... In the Bible, Eve and Adam are punished for eating fruit that they have been told will make them like God. Arachne is punished for bragging that her weaving is better than the goddess Athena's even though a weaving contest between the two shows that this is actually true.  However, I wouldn't discount the greed angle entirely- looking to seize divine power could very well be read as the ultimate form of greed. Alternately, you could say that the story shows that material wealth and success can go to people's head and make them believe that they truly are/deserve to be like gods (there are many reak world examples throughout history of the rich and powerful behaving this way). ;"

There was hardly anytime that they were not pulled into war with the rest of central Europe.   They lived in poverty (often under tyrannical monarchies).   Plus the constant religious upheaval....Catholicism or Lutherism?   It wasn't until the very end of this century that the Enlightenment movement came and lead to the Enlightenment Absolutism form of ruling in Germany.   And this finally lead to freedom of religion in the early 1900's.   How do you keep people in check?   You tell stories of those who, like you, live lives of hardship can find a ""happy ending"" by doing the right thing.   The right thing then maybe different then the right thing now.   Especially if you have never lived your entire life in a war torn country where the lives of the people was of little regard to those ruling.   The right thing may be to be like Cinderella, remain faithful and true no matter how bad things get and you will be rewarded.   While the punishment the sisters receive seem like a mid-evil form of justice the overall story is very Christian at it's core: the faithful will receive their everlasting happiness, the wicked will receive eternal damnation.      ;I hadn't gotten to Faithful John yet.   Definitely see the parallel there.;What I took away from that story was the inability to let go and how devastating it can be.   Starting with the hen.   Her inability to let go of her desire to have this nut even though they had made a pact lead to her death.   The cock does everything he can to save her, but the selfishness of others hinders him.   (This could strike a cord with those even today who go through trying to save the lives of loved ones while dealing with the red tape of insurance companies and FDA policies.)   People at this time often loss their children before the age of 10 and many children were left without at least one parent by their teens.   The cock consumed with the fact that there was nothing he could do slowly starts to consume everyone around them......could be likened to a family loosing someone very important and the family no longer being able to function.   I could be totally off....but, that what I took from the story =);"
